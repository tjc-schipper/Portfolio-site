Solutions

Whether a it is practical issue, behavioural change or product experience you have in mind, design thinking and a hands-on approach allow me to get to the bottom of things.

Experiences

I believe the user experience is key in any succesful solution. With a focus on testing early and often, I create experiences that users want to use.

So often, a project meets every written goal yet does not work in practice, because it ignores the most important person of all - the target audience. By centering my design process around the end user and embracing ongoing insights, I make sure we get the most important things down first.

Problems are rarely simple, and our first guesses are rarely correct. During any project, trade-offs will have to be made. New insights will continue to come up. Constraints will change. 
So how can we expect ourselves to get it right on the first try?

That is why I embrace flexibility in <strong>design-by-doing</strong>.

By keeping the link between the product and its users as close as possible, we can learn and improve as we go and make optimal use of the resources we have available. Through rapid prototyping, user research and a supporting iterative approach I can give you insight continuous insight into the development of your project. A design that is not just based in theory and gut instinct.
